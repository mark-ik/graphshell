# Immediate Priorities Register, Forgotten Concepts, and Quick Wins (2026-02-24)

**Status**: Moved / Compatibility Pointer (2026-02-25)

This content has been consolidated into the canonical planning document:
- `design_docs/graphshell_docs/implementation_strategy/PLANNING_REGISTER.md`

Use section:
- `## 1. Immediate Priorities Register (10/10/10)`

Reason for move:
- Reduce duplication and keep priorities, backlog ticket stubs, and Copilot guidance in one source of truth.
