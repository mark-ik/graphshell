# Graphshell Architectural Overview

**Last Updated**: February 17, 2026
**Status**: Core browsing graph functional — Servo integration, egui_tiles multi-pane, persistence, thumbnails/favicons, search/filter all working

---

## Project Vision

Graphshell is a **spatial tab manager** where webpages are nodes in a force-directed graph instead of tabs in a bar. The architecture uses three authority domains: graph/intents for semantic state, tile tree for layout and focus, and webviews for runtime rendering state reconciled from lifecycle intents.

**Core Idea**: Replace linear history with spatial memory. Instead of "Back/Forward," you see where you came from and where pages link to.

**See**: [GRAPHSHELL_AS_BROWSER.md](GRAPHSHELL_AS_BROWSER.md) for the full behavioral specification of the unified graph-tile-webview model.

## Current Implementation Status

### Foundation (~7,000 LOC total; core graph + physics ~1,300 LOC minimum)

**Graph Core** (`graph/mod.rs`)
- `Graph`: petgraph `StableGraph<Node, EdgeType, Directed>` as primary store
- `Node`: UUID identity, URL/title metadata, position, pinned, lifecycle (Active/Warm/Cold), favicon/thumbnail/session data
- `EdgeType`: Hyperlink (new tab from parent), History (back/forward), UserGrouped (explicit split-open grouping gesture).
- `NodeKey = NodeIndex`, `EdgeKey = EdgeIndex` — stable handles surviving deletions
- `url_to_nodes: HashMap<String, Vec<NodeKey>>` for URL lookup with duplicate URL support
- `out_neighbors()`, `in_neighbors()`, `has_edge_between()` for traversal
- Snapshot serialization: `to_snapshot()` / `from_snapshot()` for persistence

**egui_graphs Adapter** (`graph/egui_adapter.rs`)
- `EguiGraphState`: converts `Graph` → egui_graphs `Graph` via `to_graph_custom()`
- Sets position, label, color, radius, selection from node data
- Lifecycle-based styling: Active/Warm/Cold tiers (with selected override)
- Rebuilt only when `egui_state_dirty` flag is set (structural changes)

**Tile Tree** (`desktop/gui.rs` + `desktop/tile_runtime.rs`)
- egui_tiles multi-pane runtime: tile tree, per-pane rendering contexts, tile layout persistence
- Each tile pane has a tab bar showing its cluster's nodes (connected by edges)
- Tile-derived view state (legacy `View` enum retired)
- Tab bars are projections of graph clusters; closing/eviction paths demote to `Warm` or `Cold` via lifecycle intents

**Physics Runtime** (`app.rs` + `render/mod.rs`) — **Implemented via egui_graphs**
- Force-directed layout uses egui_graphs `FruchtermanReingoldState`
- Runtime state is app-owned (`GraphBrowserApp.physics`) and bridged through `set_layout_state`/`get_layout_state` each frame
- Physics panel controls operate directly on FR state (damping, attraction, repulsion, scale, run/pause)
- Previous custom physics module/worker path has been removed from active runtime

**Rendering** (`render/mod.rs`)
- Delegates graph visualization to `egui_graphs::GraphView` widget
- Built-in zoom/pan navigation (`SettingsNavigation`), dragging + selection (`SettingsInteraction`)
- Event-driven: NodeDoubleClick → focus, NodeDragStart/End → physics pause, NodeMove → position sync
- Info overlay: node/edge count, physics status, zoom level, controls hint
- Physics config panel: live sliders for all force parameters
- Post-frame zoom clamp: enforces min/max bounds on egui_graphs zoom

**Input** (`input/mod.rs`, 87 lines)
- Mouse interaction delegated to egui_graphs (drag, pan, zoom, selection, double-click)
- Keyboard shortcuts (guarded — disabled when text field has focus):
  - `T` toggle physics, `Z` smart fit, `+`/`-`/`0` zoom controls, `P` physics panel, `N` new node
  - `Home`/`Esc` toggle Graph/Detail view
  - `Del` remove selected, `Ctrl+Shift+Del` clear graph

**Application State** (`app.rs`)
- Tile-derived view state (graph pane vs detail panes determined by tile tree)
- Bidirectional webview↔node mapping: `HashMap<WebViewId, NodeKey>` and inverse
- Selection management (single/multi), focus switching
- FR layout state lifecycle (sync app-owned state with egui_graphs per frame)
- Persistence integration: log mutations, periodic snapshots
- `egui_state_dirty` flag controls when egui_graphs state is rebuilt
- Camera: zoom bounds (0.1x–10.0x), post-frame clamping via `MetadataFrame`

**Persistence** (`persistence/` module, 560 lines total)
- **fjall**: Append-only operation log (every mutation: AddNode, AddEdge, UpdateTitle, PinNode)
- **redb**: Periodic snapshots (full graph serialization, every 5 minutes)
- **rkyv**: Zero-copy serialization for both log entries and snapshots
- Startup recovery: load latest snapshot → replay log entries since snapshot
- Aligned data handling: `AlignedVec` for rkyv deserialization from redb bytes

**Servo Integration** (`desktop/gui.rs` + `desktop/webview_controller.rs`, ~2,100 lines total)
- Full webview lifecycle: create/destroy webviews based on tile tree state
- Graph view: destroy all webviews (prevent framebuffer bleed), save node list for restoration
- Detail view: recreate webviews for saved nodes, create for newly focused nodes
- Delegate-driven semantic events flow into the intent reducer for URL/title/history updates
- Servo signals: `request_create_new` (new tab), `notify_url_changed` (within-tab nav), `notify_title_changed`
- Edge creation: Hyperlink for new tab from parent, History for back/forward (existing reverse edge)

### Not Yet Implemented

**In active development:**

1. **Navigation control-plane follow-up** — desktop delegate-driven routing is implemented; remaining parity work is EGL/WebDriver explicit targeting ([lifecycle model](../implementation_strategy/2026-02-21_lifecycle_intent_model.md), [decomposition plan](../implementation_strategy/2026-02-20_embedder_decomposition_plan.md))
2. **Selection consolidation** — Remove duplicated selection state ([plan](../../archive_docs/checkpoint_2026-02-19/2026-02-14_selection_semantics_plan.md))
3. **Physics follow-up** — Keep FR tuning/profile work visible after migration ([plan](../../archive_docs/checkpoint_2026-02-19/2026-02-14_physics_migration_plan.md))

**Phase 2+ features (not started):**

- Bookmarks/history import
- Performance optimization (500+ nodes)
- Clipping (DOM element extraction)
- Diagnostic/Engine Inspector mode
- P2P collaboration (Verse)

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Structures

**Why petgraph StableGraph?**
- Stable indices survive node/edge deletions (unlike `Graph` which reuses indices)
- Rich algorithm ecosystem (pathfinding, centrality, clustering) available via trait imports
- `pub(crate) inner` gives egui_adapter direct access for `to_graph_custom()`
- Eliminates the SlotMap + manual adjacency list approach (simpler, fewer data structures)

**Why `url_to_nodes` HashMap?**
- Fast URL lookup while preserving duplicate tab semantics.
- Supports non-identity URL search/recovery helpers.
- Node identity is UUID-based; URL is mutable metadata, not identity.

**Why NodeIndex keys are not stable across sessions?**
- petgraph NodeIndex values change when graph is rebuilt from persistence.
- Persistence and identity use UUID (`node_id`) rather than NodeIndex.
- URL remains mutable metadata and may be duplicated.

### Rendering & UI

**Why egui_graphs?**
- Purpose-built for interactive graph visualization in egui
- Provides zoom/pan, dragging, selection, labels out of the box
- Event-driven interaction model (events collected in `Rc<RefCell<Vec<Event>>>`)
- Reduced custom rendering code by ~80% (input went from 313 → 100 LOC)

**Why `FruchtermanReingold` layout in egui_graphs?**
- Removes custom physics/worker complexity while keeping force-directed behavior
- Keeps layout integration inside GraphView (single framework path)
- Supports the existing physics panel and interaction model with fewer bespoke subsystems
- See [2026-02-14_physics_migration_plan.md](../../archive_docs/checkpoint_2026-02-19/2026-02-14_physics_migration_plan.md)

**Why post-frame zoom clamp?**
- egui_graphs has no built-in zoom bounds
- Read `MetadataFrame` from egui's persisted data after `GraphView` renders
- Clamp zoom value, write back if changed

### Graph-Tile-Webview Unified Model

**Why three authority domains instead of one mutable source?**
- Graph/intents own semantic truth (identity, lifecycle, edges).
- Tile tree owns spatial layout, pane focus, and visibility.
- Webviews are runtime side effects reconciled from graph lifecycle.
- This split prevents contradictory update loops while keeping rendering/runtime concerns explicit.
- See [GRAPHSHELL_AS_BROWSER.md](GRAPHSHELL_AS_BROWSER.md) for behavioral specification.

**Why intent-based mutation?**
- Extends existing `GraphAction`/`KeyboardActions` pattern to cover tile operations
- All interactions produce intents collected during the frame, applied together at one sync point
- No system directly mutates another mid-frame — eliminates the class of bugs from the servoshell tab UI adaptation

**Two-Phase Apply Model**

All user interactions and lifecycle events flow through intent/reconciliation boundaries:

**Phase 1 — Pure Reducer** (state mutation):
- Processes `GraphIntent` enum (CreateNode, UpdateUrl, AddEdge, etc.)
- Updates graph structure, node metadata, and desired lifecycle state
- No Servo calls; all side effects deferred

**Phase 2 — Reconciliation** (webview side effects):
- Converges observed runtime state toward desired lifecycle state
- Creates/destroys webviews based on desired state and backpressure policy
- Emits follow-up intents for the next frame when required

**Invariant**: Sub-frame gap between phases. No mid-frame mixed mutation prevents contradictory webview state (e.g., navigating a destroyed webview, creating duplicate webviews for the same node).

**Lifecycle Intent Vocabulary (authoritative)**: `PromoteNodeToActive`, `DemoteNodeToWarm`, `DemoteNodeToCold`, `MarkRuntimeBlocked`, `ClearRuntimeBlocked`, plus runtime mapping intents (`MarkRuntimeCreatePending`, `MarkRuntimeCreateConfirmed`).
For full details (causes, desired vs observed runtime states, invariants), see [implementation_strategy/2026-02-21_lifecycle_intent_model.md](../implementation_strategy/2026-02-21_lifecycle_intent_model.md).

**Delegate-driven routing**: Servo callbacks → GraphIntent emission → reducer application → reconciliation effects. No polling, no fragmented mutation paths.

See [2026-02-21_lifecycle_intent_model.md](../implementation_strategy/2026-02-21_lifecycle_intent_model.md) and [2026-02-20_embedder_decomposition_plan.md](../implementation_strategy/2026-02-20_embedder_decomposition_plan.md) for current specification and implementation timeline.

**Why nodes ARE tabs (not representations of tabs)?**
- Node identity is the tab itself (stable UUID), not its URL
- Within-tab navigation updates the node's URL; no new node created
- Duplicate URLs allowed (same URL open in multiple tabs = multiple independent nodes)
- Per-node history provided by Servo's `notify_history_changed`, not custom stacks

### Webview Lifecycle

**Why destroy webviews in graph view?**
- Servo renders webviews into the window framebuffer
- In graph view, webview content bleeds through the graph overlay
- Solution: save which nodes had webviews, destroy all, recreate on return to detail view

**Why the frame execution order matters (gui.rs):**
1. Handle keyboard (may change view or clear graph)
2. Collect/apply semantic intents (UI + delegate events)
3. Reconcile webview lifecycle (destroy/create based on tile + lifecycle state)
4. Toolbar + tab bar rendering
5. Physics update
6. View rendering (graph OR detail, exclusive)

If intent apply/reconcile ordering drifts, runtime state can diverge from graph intent state. Keep apply and reconcile adjacent at frame boundary.

### Persistence

**Why fjall + redb + rkyv?**
- **fjall**: LSM-tree append log, write-optimized, ACID, pure Rust — every mutation logged
- **redb**: B-tree KV store, faster than sled, ACID — periodic full snapshots
- **rkyv**: Zero-copy serialization, fastest in Rust — used for both log and snapshot format
- Recovery: load latest redb snapshot, replay fjall log entries since snapshot timestamp
- Aligned data: redb bytes aren't aligned for rkyv; copy to `AlignedVec` before deserializing

## External Repo Lessons (Feb 11 2026)

Scope: Readme/docs and selected files from GraphRAG, Midori Desktop, egui_node_graph2, BrowseGraph, and Obsidian releases. Obsidian releases does not include app source; Midori Desktop is a large Firefox-derived tree so findings emphasize structure and UI modularization.

### Cross-Repo Patterns Worth Adopting

**Factory/Provider registration (GraphRAG)**
- Pattern: pluggable providers with registration and lazy loading for storage, cache, vector stores, logging, metrics, and pipelines.
- Lesson: define stable interfaces and a registry for Graphshell subsystems (storage, graph store, LLM, indexing, thumbnailing) so implementations can swap without UI churn.

**Local-first data + privacy tiers (BrowseGraph)**
- Pattern: local vector DB (pglite + pgvector), local LLM classification/summarization, minimal cloud calls for graph transforms.
- Lesson: favor local extraction and indexing; allow cloud augmentation only with explicit opt-in and minimal payloads.

**Command palette as primary navigation (BrowseGraph + Obsidian ecosystem)**
- Pattern: cmdk-driven search/command UI; Obsidian relies on a strong command and plugin ecosystem.
- Lesson: make search, node creation, and graph actions accessible via a fast command palette to reduce UI clutter.

**Trait-based UI customization (egui_node_graph2)**
- Pattern: graph model is generic; node UI is driven by traits for data types, values, node templates, and user responses.
- Lesson: keep Graphshell graph model separate from UI widgets; use explicit trait-like interfaces for node rendering, interactions, and extensibility.

**UI modular controllers (Midori Desktop)**
- Pattern: many small controllers with explicit responsibilities and explicit wiring (sidebar_main, settings controller, resizer, mover, patcher).
- Lesson: Graphshell UI should be decomposed into controller-style modules with narrow responsibilities and explicit orchestration.

**Ecosystem distribution and schema discipline (Obsidian releases)**
- Pattern: plugin/theme registries are data-first (JSON registries), with strict conventions and distributed release fetching.
- Lesson: if Graphshell adopts a plugin system, start with a strict registry schema and a clear update and compatibility story.

### Architecture Implications for Graphshell

**Pluggable graph services**
- Add a provider registry for: storage, persistence strategy, vector store, embedding provider, graph extractor, and thumbnail renderer.
- Align this with config-driven selection (GraphRAG-style config sections) so headless automation and UI can share the same defaults.

**Local-first knowledge graph pipeline**
- Implement a minimal local pipeline for: text extraction, entity/relationship extraction, and index storage.
- Reserve cloud LLMs for optional enrichment steps and allow strict data minimization (summary or entity list only).

**Command palette as a spine**
- A primary command palette can unify: node search, open URL, toggle physics, pin, snapshot, export, and graph queries.
- This reduces dependence on multiple panels and keeps the graph view clean.

**UI layering and controller model**
- Follow Midori's controller separation: distinct modules for graph view, detail view, sidebar, command palette, and persistence UI.
- Keep graph interactions as a single module that owns selection, pan/zoom, and node editing.

**Theme and UX extension surface**
- Obsidian-style theme registry implies: theme tokens, CSS-like theming, and preview surfaces.
- Graphshell should define a stable theme token palette early, even if only a few built-in themes exist.

### Concrete Crate/Library Considerations

- **Vector storage**: evaluate a local vector store approach similar to pglite + pgvector (Rust equivalents could be sqlite + sqlite-vss or an embedded HNSW implementation).
- **Command palette**: use a dedicated command palette widget in egui (custom or port a cmdk-like interaction model).
- **Node graph UI**: consider egui_node_graph2 patterns for type-safe customization and a clear data/UI separation, even if we stay on egui_graphs for rendering.

### Servo Leverage Opportunities

**Structured content extraction**
- Use Servo's DOM and layout pipeline to extract text, headings, links, and metadata for graph enrichment.
- Add an internal extraction interface so graph nodes can refresh their summaries as pages mutate.

**Thumbnail and favicon pipeline**
- Implement offscreen rendering in Servo to generate node thumbnails without visible webviews.
- Store thumbnails in persistence and update on navigation or page idle.

**Navigation event fidelity**
- Capture navigation events at the engine layer to distinguish new navigations vs history traversal; avoid heuristic edge typing.
- Use this to generate cleaner History edges and to label link provenance.

**Side-panel and split-view groundwork**
- Servo already supports multiple webviews; use this to build a dedicated sidebar or split view without rehydrating webviews from scratch.
- Wire this into the controller model so views can be swapped without tearing down engine state.
