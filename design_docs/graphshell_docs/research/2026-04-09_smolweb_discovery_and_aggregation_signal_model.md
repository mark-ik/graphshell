# Smolweb Discovery and Aggregation Signal Model

**Date**: 2026-04-09
**Status**: Research-to-architecture follow-on note
**Purpose**: Define the distinct signal lanes implied by CAPCOM, Antenna,
Cosmos, Spacewalk, GUS, and Wander so Graphshell can grow user-visible
Middlenet discovery without collapsing all external inputs into one vague
"aggregator" concept.

## 1. Why This Note Exists

Graphshell already knows about a useful set of external smolweb services and
practices:

- CAPCOM,
- Antenna,
- Cosmos,
- Spacewalk,
- GUS,
- Wander.

The gap is no longer awareness. The gap is product shape.

If Graphshell flattens all of these into one undifferentiated "aggregator"
surface, it loses the most useful thing they teach:

- discovery is not freshness,
- freshness is not clustering,
- clustering is not search,
- search is not neighborhood traversal.

This note defines those lanes explicitly.

---

## 2. Core Position

Graphshell should treat smolweb discovery as a **multi-signal graph enrichment
problem**, not as a single ranking feed.

The five core signal families are:

1. **Discovery**: what exists and might be worth following.
2. **Freshness**: what changed recently.
3. **Clustering**: what belongs together as one thread or constellation.
4. **Search**: what matches an explicit query.
5. **Neighborhood traversal**: what becomes visible by walking trusted or
   selected local recommendation paths.

Every imported result should retain signal provenance instead of being merged
into one opaque score.

---

## 3. Signal Families and Example Sources

### 3.1 Discovery

Primary question:

- what feeds, capsules, boards, or sources should the user know exist?

Representative sources:

- CAPCOM,
- Spacewalk,
- curated discovery packs,
- future community-maintained source lists.

Expected output shape:

- candidate subscriptions,
- source nodes,
- wayfinding surfaces,
- provenance on where the suggestion came from.

### 3.2 Freshness

Primary question:

- what changed recently enough that the user may care now?

Representative sources:

- Antenna,
- recency-aware feed polling,
- source-health and update pipelines.

Expected output shape:

- recent-update surfaces,
- source health views,
- stale/empty/broken signals distinct from discovery.

### 3.3 Clustering

Primary question:

- which items belong to one thread, issue space, or local world?

Representative sources:

- Cosmos,
- Bubble-like reply/reference networks,
- future cross-source citation/reply grouping.

Expected output shape:

- constellation projections,
- thread graphlets,
- anchor/frontier relationships,
- local-world navigation views.

### 3.4 Search

Primary question:

- what best matches this explicit query right now?

Representative sources:

- GUS-like search services,
- future local or hybrid search indexes.

Expected output shape:

- result sets with engine provenance,
- query context,
- index freshness/coverage information.

### 3.5 Neighborhood Traversal

Primary question:

- what becomes discoverable by walking recommendation neighborhoods rather than
  running a direct query?

Representative sources:

- Wander,
- future community neighborhood graphs,
- trusted-console walk paths.

Expected output shape:

- explainable walk trails,
- discovery provenance by path,
- bounded random-walk or neighborhood exploration surfaces.

---

## 4. Product Rule: Keep Signals Distinct

Graphshell should not flatten discovery inputs into one generic "smolweb feed"
unless the user explicitly asks for a blended view.

Separate by default:

- discovery candidates,
- subscriptions,
- recent updates,
- clustered threads/constellations,
- search results,
- neighborhood exploration.

Blended views are allowed later, but only if they remain explainable and retain
signal provenance.

---

## 5. Provenance Requirements

Every surfaced item should be able to answer at least:

- why am I seeing this?
- which signal family surfaced it?
- which source or engine contributed it?
- when was it observed or indexed?
- is this a candidate, a subscribed item, a clustered relation, or a search
  hit?

This is required both for user trust and for Graphshell's graph-native product
identity.

---

## 6. Graph Object Implications

This signal model implies at least four object classes around external sources:

1. **Source node**.
   A feed, capsule, board, engine, or neighborhood source.
2. **Imported content node**.
   A post, entry, page, issue item, or other discovered artifact.
3. **Signal/provenance record**.
   Why the item was surfaced, through which lane, and when.
4. **User subscription or follow state**.
   The user's explicit continuing relationship to the source.

Graphshell should resist collapsing all of these into one imported page node.

---

## 7. User-Visible Middlenet Growth Track

This note defines the first architectural slice for user-visible Middlenet
growth.

Recommended order:

1. discovery/freshness/clustering/search/neighborhood taxonomy,
2. source-node and subscription-state model,
3. discovery packs,
4. recent-update/source-health surfaces,
5. constellation projection prototype,
6. search provenance surfaces.

This sequence produces useful browsing growth before Graphshell commits to a
large unified ranking system.

---

## 8. Immediate Follow-On Deliverables

The next notes or implementation-facing follow-ons should be:

1. a source/subscription manager note,
2. a discovery-pack manifest note,
3. a constellation projection note,
4. provenance UI rules for surfaced discovery results,
5. retention rules for imported/discovered artifacts vs saved items.

The key architectural discipline is simple: **separate the signals, preserve
their provenance, and let Graphshell combine them deliberately rather than by
accident.**
