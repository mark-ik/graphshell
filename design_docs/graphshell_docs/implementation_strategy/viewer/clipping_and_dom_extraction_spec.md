## 1. Scope

This spec defines the canonical contracts for:

1. **Context menu event** — `GraphSemanticEvent::ContextMenu` and its trigger path.
2. **Script injection contract** — how DOM extraction is performed via `EmbedderApi`.
3. **Clip node data model** — the `#clip` tag, address scheme, and edge semantics.
4. **Graph rendering of clip nodes** — how clip nodes appear in the canvas.

---

## 2. Context Menu Event Contract

### 2.1 Trigger Path

DOM extraction is initiated from the viewer's context menu. When the user right-clicks within a Servo-rendered tile:

1. The browser engine fires a native context menu event.
2. Servo's embedder layer intercepts it and emits `GraphSemanticEvent::ContextMenu`.
3. Graphshell's event pipeline receives `GraphSemanticEvent::ContextMenu` and displays the Graphshell context menu (not the browser's native context menu).

**Invariant**: The browser's native context menu must be suppressed. `GraphSemanticEvent::ContextMenu` is the sole trigger for context menu display within Servo-rendered tiles.

### 2.2 GraphSemanticEvent::ContextMenu

```
GraphSemanticEvent::ContextMenu {
    node_key: NodeKey,         -- the node whose viewer was right-clicked
    position: PhysicalPoint,   -- screen position of the right-click
    hit: ContextMenuHit,       -- what was under the cursor
}

ContextMenuHit =
  | Text { selected: Option<String> }   -- right-click on text; optional selection
  | Image { src_url: String }           -- right-click on an image
  | Link { href: String }               -- right-click on a link
  | Background                          -- right-click on page background
```

**Invariant**: `ContextMenuHit` is determined by Servo at event time. Graphshell must not re-derive hit information from DOM queries after the event arrives — the hit data in the event is authoritative.

### 2.3 Clip Action in Context Menu

The Graphshell context menu includes a "Clip selection" item when `ContextMenuHit::Text { selected: Some(_) }` is present, and a "Clip image" item when `ContextMenuHit::Image` is present.

Activating a clip action emits a `ClipContent` intent:

```
GraphIntent::ClipContent {
    source_node_key: NodeKey,
    clip_kind: ClipKind,
}

ClipKind =
  | SelectedText { text: String }
  | Image { src_url: String }
  | FullPage
```

**Invariant**: `ClipContent` is the only intent that creates clip nodes. No code path other than `ClipContent` intent processing may create a `NodeState` with `#clip` tag.

---

## 3. Script Injection Contract

For `FullPage` clip kind and for cases where richer DOM structure is needed beyond what `ContextMenuHit` provides, Graphshell uses `EmbedderApi` to inject a script into the active page.

### 3.1 EmbedderApi::inject_script

```
EmbedderApi::inject_script(
    node_key: NodeKey,
    script: &str,
    callback: impl Fn(ScriptResult) + Send + 'static,
)
```

- `script` is a JavaScript string injected into the page's top-level frame.
- `callback` receives the serialized return value as a JSON string.
- Injection is asynchronous; the callback runs on the embedder event thread.

**Invariant**: Scripts injected via `EmbedderApi` must be read-only. They must not mutate page DOM state, submit forms, or initiate navigation. Violations are a security bug.

**Invariant**: The script content is constructed by Graphshell, not by user input or page content. No user-controlled string is interpolated into the script without sanitization.

### 3.2 DOM Extraction Script

For full-page clipping, the injected script:
1. Serializes the visible text content of the page (inner text, not raw HTML).
2. Extracts `<meta>` tags (title, description, og:*, twitter:*).
3. Returns a JSON object with keys: `title`, `description`, `text`, `url`.

The callback stores the JSON result as the clip node's content body (see §4.2).

**Invariant**: The extraction script does not exfiltrate cookies, localStorage, or any credential data. It reads only publicly visible page content.

---

## 4. Clip Node Data Model Contract

### 4.1 NodeState and Tag

A clip node is an ordinary graph node with:

- `node_state: NodeState::Active` (clip nodes are active nodes, not a special lifecycle state)
- Tag: `#clip` (system-managed; see `node_badge_and_tagging_spec.md §2.1`)
- `address_kind: AddressKind::GraphshellClip`
- `address: "graphshell://clip/<uuid>"`

**Invariant**: The `#clip` tag is in the `#` reserved namespace. It must not be user-removable while the node retains clip content. Removing clip content (via "Delete clip" action) removes the tag and transitions the node to a standard empty node or triggers node deletion.

### 4.2 Content Storage

Clip content is stored at the `graphshell://clip/<uuid>` address in the local graphshell storage layer. The storage format depends on the clip kind:

| ClipKind | Storage format |
|----------|---------------|
| `SelectedText` | `text/plain` or `text/markdown` |
| `Image` | Original image bytes; MIME type from source |
| `FullPage` | JSON (title, description, text, url from extraction script) |

**Invariant**: Clip content is stored locally. No clip content is transmitted to external services.

**Invariant**: The `<uuid>` in the address is generated fresh at clip creation time. It is stable and does not change for the lifetime of the clip node.

### 4.3 Edge to Source Node

When a clip node is created from a source node, a `UserGrouped` edge is created between the clip node and the source node:

```
Edge {
    kind: EdgeKind::UserGrouped,
    source: clip_node_key,
    target: source_node_key,
    label: "clipped from",
}
```

**Invariant**: The edge is created atomically with the clip node (same `LogEntry` batch). A clip node without an edge to its source is an invalid state.

**Invariant**: Deleting the source node does not automatically delete clip nodes derived from it. The edge becomes a `UserGrouped` edge to a tombstoned node (or, if the source is hard-deleted, a dangling edge that is repaired at load time by removing it).

---

## 5. Graph Rendering of Clip Nodes

### 5.1 Visual Style

Clip nodes render on the canvas with a distinct visual identity:

- Node body background: distinct tint (e.g., amber/yellow in the default theme) to differentiate from web nodes.
- Node badge: `#clip` badge rendered in the primary badge slot (highest-priority system badge).
- Node label: clip title if available; otherwise the truncated UUID.

**Invariant**: Clip node visual style is defined in `CanvasStylePolicy`. It must not be hardcoded in the render path.

### 5.2 Viewer for Clip Nodes

Clip nodes use `ClipViewer` (see `universal_content_model_spec.md §6`). `ClipViewer`:

- Reads content from `graphshell://clip/<uuid>` storage.
- Renders text clips as scrollable text (via `PlaintextViewer` logic).
- Renders image clips as `ImageViewer` content.
- Renders full-page clips as a structured card (title, description, excerpt).

`TileRenderMode` for clip nodes is always `EmbeddedEgui`.

### 5.3 Interaction on Clip Nodes

| Interaction | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| Click | Select clip node; focused pane shows `ClipViewer` content |
| Right-click | Context menu: "Open source", "Delete clip", "Copy text", "Export" |
| "Open source" | Emit `NavigateTo` for the source node's address |
| Double-click | Same as clicking the source edge's target (navigate to source) |

**Invariant**: "Delete clip" removes the clip content from storage, removes the `#clip` tag, and deletes the clip node. This is irreversible (no tombstone; clip content is not preserved post-deletion).

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Verification |
|-----------|-------------|
| Browser native context menu suppressed in Servo tile | Test: right-click in Servo tile → no browser context menu shown |
| `GraphSemanticEvent::ContextMenu` emitted on right-click | Test: right-click → `ContextMenu` event in event stream with correct `node_key` and `hit` |
| Clip node address is `graphshell://clip/<uuid>` | Test: create clip → node address matches scheme |
| `#clip` tag is system-managed and non-removable by user | Test: attempt to remove `#clip` tag via tag panel → tag remains |
| Clip content stored locally, no external transmission | Architecture invariant: no outbound network calls during `ClipContent` intent processing |
| `UserGrouped` edge created with clip node | Test: create clip → edge exists from clip node to source node |
| Injected script does not read cookies or localStorage | Architecture invariant: extraction script source contains no `document.cookie` or `localStorage` access |
| `ClipViewer` selected for `GraphshellClip` address | Test: clip node → `ViewerRegistry::select` returns `ClipViewer` |
| "Delete clip" removes content and node | Test: delete clip → `graphshell://clip/<uuid>` address no longer resolves; node gone |
| `ClipContent` is the only clip node creator | Architecture invariant: no `#clip`-tagged node creation outside `ClipContent` intent handler |
